## 🛠 Technologies
* **HTML5 and CSS3.** All grid and utility classes built from scratch, using naming scheme borrowed from Bootstrap for familiarity.
* **Netlify** for deployment of the website demo. No backend for now.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 💾 Installation
* Clone this repo to your local machine and launch in your browser to give it a test.
* This is a **purely frontend experience** with no data being capture by the form at the moment.
* Customize it, make it your own, and deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku etc.
